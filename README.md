# Texlive snap

> clone of the NucciTheBoss snap.
> Warning - this snap package is still a work-in-progress.

"The basic scheme of TexLive in a snap! This is a clone of the snap: https://github.com/NucciTheBoss/texlive."
*  The description above refers to the software: https://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/
* I have packaged the software as a snap for **personal use** but I have made the snap available for free. It can be used as a standalone snap. It was created to share 'content' with other snaps I package.
* I do not maintain the software itself. I only maintain the snap packaging. Please report software bugs to the maintainers.
* Report snap-specific bugs to me.
* I _DO_ use this snap. It _has been superficially tested_ on my system. I __do not__ track the latest version.
* __This snap works in strictly confined mode.__
* Packaging 'style' : tarball build for linux machines.
* License refers to the original software, not the snapcraft 'code'.
* More info:
* Run the following to rename the snap
```sudo snap alias rjd-texlive.pdflatex pdflatex```
